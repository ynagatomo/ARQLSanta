This is a minimal AR iOS app that uses the AR Quick Look API, displaying the bundled rcproject file as an AR scene. In this scene there is a Santa doll that responds to taps.

- Xcode 13.2.1
- Target: iOS / iPadOS 14.0+

Let's use Reality Composer to create your AR scene and replace the rcproject file in the Xcode project. Then you have your own AR app!


This code is explained in the articles below.
